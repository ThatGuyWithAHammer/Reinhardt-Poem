With hammer high and armor bright,
Reinhardt charges into the fight.
His shield defends his comrades well,
As he unleashes a mighty yell.

He swings his hammer with great force,
Knocking foes off their intended course.
He charges forward without fear,
For he knows victory is near.

With honor and valor as his guide,
Reinhardt stands tall, full of pride.
In battle, he's a true delight,
Our hero, Reinhardt, shining bright.
